### Introduction

scQCEA is an R package for annotation and quality control report of scRNA-Seq profiles, which performs a probabilistic assignment of the reference cell types to identify clusters, before downstream analysis such as gene network inference. scQCEA provides automated cell type annotation on scRNA-seq data and identifies differential patterns in gene expression. scQCEA generates an interactive report of quality control metrics which allows visual evaluation of QC metrics, objective selection of insightful optimal cluster numbers and discrimination between true variation and background noise.

The easiest way to generate an interactive summary QC report is use the outputs of CellTypeEnrichmentAnalysis function and run the scQCEA Shiny Markdown. The required inputs are a gene-cell count matrix, feature-barcode matrices, and tSNE and UMAP projections from 10X CellRanger count.

### Input data
As input, the scQCEA package expects raw count data from 10X CellRanger or other single cell experiments, and optional arguments such as appropriate organism. The gene-cell count data has the gene as row (the gene name should be the human or mouse Ensembl gene ID) and the cell as column. You can convert a HDF5 Feature-Barcode Matrix to gene-cell count matrix using the cellranger mat2csv command provided by 10Xgenomics. The tSNE and UMAP projections are the outputs of dimensionality reduction analysis in csv format.

### Cell Type Enrichment analysis
Example of running CellTypeEnrichmentAnalysis function:

```{r,eval=FALSE}

library(scQCEA)
project_id='P180121'
gex_library_id='481207_03'
input.dir='/10X-gex/481207_03'
backend.data.dir='/Back_End_Data'
organism='hsapiens'
parent.dir='~/scQCEA/inst/extdata'
CellTypeEnrichmentAnalysis(project_id, gex_library_id, input.dir, backend.data.dir, organism, parent.dir)
```

### HTML report: interactive QC report

It is easy to create an interactive QC report for those who possess little or no programming language skills. To run and generate an interative QC report on your computer please:

1. Install the R (https://cran.r-project.org/)

2. Install the free version of rStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Open the "CLICK_ME.Rmd" file inside the folder [scQCEA_Interactive_Report] using rStudio, and click on the "Knite" blue icon. The user interface of the database will come up as a new window, and create an interactive QC report in one HTML file. By default, the HTML report will be written in your working directory named CLICK_ME.html. You can open and share CLICK_ME.html without using rStudio/R.

The scQCEA generates a QC report as an HTML file including four sections: experimental workflow, data processing workflow, samples information and QC metrics, data analysis and quality control.
