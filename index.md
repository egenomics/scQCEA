## Main

This documentation gives an introduction and usage manual of scQCEA (A Framework for Annotation and Quality Control Report of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data), for annotating and interpreting scRNA-Seq data.

scQCEA is an R package for annotation and quality control report of scRNA-Seq profiles. It generates an interactive report of quality control metrics which allows visual evaluation of QC metrics, objective selection of insightful optimal cluster numbers and discrimination between true variation and background noise.

The easiest way to generate an interactive summary QC report is run the RUN_ME.R script from the RStudio. The required inputs are a gene-cell count matrix, feature-barcode matrices, and tSNE and UMAP projections from 10X CellRanger count.
