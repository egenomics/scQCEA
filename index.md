## scQCEA

### Introduction 

This documentation gives an introduction and usage manual of scQCEA (A Framework for Annotation and Quality Control Report of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data), for annotating and interpreting scRNA-Seq data.

scQCEA is an R package for annotation and quality control report of scRNA-Seq profiles. It generates an interactive report of quality control metrics which allows visual evaluation of QC metrics, objective selection of insightful optimal cluster numbers and discrimination between true variation and background noise.

The easiest way to generate an interactive summary QC report is run the RUN_ME.R script from the RStudio. The required inputs are a gene-cell count matrix, feature-barcode matrices, and tSNE and UMAP projections from 10X CellRanger count.

### Easy Installation

1. Install the R (https://cran.r-project.org/)

2. Install the free version of rStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. To install scQCEA, run the RUN_ME.R script from the RStudio. All dependency packages automatically will be downloaded, installed and loaded from CRAN-like repositories. The following versions of its dependencies are compatible with the library:

***Required packages in R:**

readr_2.1.0       
dplyr_1.0.7        
data.table_1.14.2 
ggplot2_3.3.5      
downloadthis_0.2.1
DT_0.19            
bsselectR_0.1.0    
stringr_1.4.0     
rstudioapi_0.13    
rmarkdown_2.11  
kableExtra_1.3.4
R.utils_2.11.0 

***Environment:** 

We only tested scQCEA in R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) environment. You need to have the root permission for this distribution, including installation of any package.

### Install from source code

Alternatively, you can download the source codes from CRAN and install libraries using the terminal as follows:"

library(stringr)

library(bsselectR)

library(kableExtra)

library(DT)

library(downloadthis)

library(ggplot2)

library(data.table)

library(dplyr)

library(readr)

library(rmarkdown)

library(R.utils)

library(rstudioapi)




### Markdown

It is easy to create an interactive QC report for those who possess little or no programming language skills. To run and generate an interative QC report on your computer please:
